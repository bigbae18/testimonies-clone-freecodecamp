# First React Project (1/5)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

You can access to a [Live Demo](https://bigbae18.github.io/testimonies-clone-freecodecamp/) of the page without needing to have a [Local Setup](#local-setup).

## Local Setup

You need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to clone this repository on your local project. Also, you would need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/) to be able to install the dependencies this project needs. 

Open a new terminal and type the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/bigbae18/testimonies-clone-freecodecamp.git
```

This would create a new folder called `testimonies-clone-freecodecamp` in the folder you opened the terminal. To access this folder, type the command:

```
cd testimonies-clone-freecodecamp
```

After being inside the folder and having [Node](https://nodejs.org/es/) installed (You can check it by typing in the terminal `node -v` and if it returns you the version of Node, then it's ok!), you have to type the command below to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, when the dependencies are installed, now you can just type the command below to start the project and see how does it look like:

```
npm start
```

### Resources

This project is a recreation of a functional component and passing props to it of a testimonial card from a past student of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
